## Abstract
This project aims to study the feasibility of haptic feedback in a 3D space. There is an increasing demand for such solutions, mainly in rehabilitation since they remove the need for a daily appointment with a therapist and enable the gamification of rehabilitation.
Some solutions already exist but remain very expensive since they are based on 3-axis arms. Nowadays, a lot of progress in the field of aerial robotics has been done and it is time to consider using the principles of flying drones to take over this task.

## Chasis design and flow simulation
The first approach to the solution consist on a graspable device which includes 4 propellers. The device should account for the user safety as well as for the air flow of the chasis. The proposed solution flow simulation is presented bellow.

## Trajectory control
To provide an adecuate haptic feedback the device needs to be controlled accuratelly, both to provide a good trajectory as well as "Reject disturbances", which in this case would consist on fighthing the weight of the hand, or providing a resistance against the movement as an exercise.
