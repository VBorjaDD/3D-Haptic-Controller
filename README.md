It was proven in the past that there is room in the market for wearables/controllers to stimulate the user to exercise while doing an entertaining activity. Commercially available devices developed for this purpose are either active tools operating on the 2D space, or passive tools operating in the 3D space (like the Nintendo Wii). The proposed device is
an active tool operating in the 3D space. It consists of a graspable controller capable of exerting forces through the use of propellers influencing the arm trajectory. The controller will have the capacity of connecting with existing commercial devices, either gaming platforms such as Nintendo Wii, or virtual reality and augmented reality sets.
The device is intended primarily for 2 uses:
1. To enhance and enrich an experience through the use of haptic feedback.
2. As a tool to be used for training motor capacities. The device would be capable of exerting forces in the 3D space either to assist in the movement or to oppose it depending on the necessities of the user, hence providing a user-tailored tool.
The aforementioned tailoring can be followed up by performance tracking, fatigue and special needs, which would be used to increase the quality of training and tracking of the evolution.

Bellow it can be found videos of the last stabilizing test:
